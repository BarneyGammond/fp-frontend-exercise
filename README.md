## Design Considerations
-- Project may not have warranted a full styling framework like Tailwind but in the interest of scaling this itâ€™s a good idea to implement a framework for future consistency
-- Considered adding a build step in case of being fleshed into a more full-scale SPA but decided against it to reduce complexity
-- Some type of form validation, where the input displays the error, would have been better for cases where negative amounts were entered but to save time I added a notification emit
-- Chose to opt for the closest web safe font to the original design, with more time and the option to contact the designer a more exact font would have been better
-- The recalculate functionality is based on the assumption that an api would be updating in real time
